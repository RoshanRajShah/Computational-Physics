Algorithm.\n","\n","\n","A square lattice was formed of size L x L, the sites were set with points were set with either spin up or spin down. \n","\n","Starting by setting T = 0 , the  ground state energy was calculated and was found to be in the range of -500 J to -800 J, which can represented in the range but as the, energy decreases so does the magnetic field, from the data. From basics, if all the magnetic spin is aligned in the same direction, the substance is considered ferromagnetic. In this case either the spin can be -1 or 1 depending on the polarizing force field applied. Normally, the excited state has the energy of 4 J or - 4 J, thus the total energy being in equal to 8 J. \n","\n","As the T goes to infinity, the  neighbouring spin becomes 0 as the probability is 1. This gives us knowledge that the spin lattice is not aligned, which also sets energy and the magnetic field to zero.\n","\n","The plot of the final configuration for each $T'$ is printed. \n","\n","From the graph of Energy and Magnetization with respect to temperature, it is observed that as the energy increases with increasing temperature, the magnetization decreases.\n","\n","#### Finding the minimum value of n, for an array of T' : $n_{min}$\n","\n","When the simulation is run using different values of the $n_o$ at different T', the values of the n' are determined by passing all the values in the array of the T'. The behaviour seems to chage for the smaller values of T' in the array but for the larger values the change is very small to the point that it is impossible to detect. \n","\n","\n","#### Onsager's Approach Solution \n","\n","As the values of the T increased so did the error numbers, smaller values of the T showed very little change in the error.\n","\n","#### Quantifying $n_{min}$ and errors depending on $L$\n","\n","\n","One thing was evidently clear, that as the value of the n_min increased the so did the size of the error bars, giving us idea that the error rages were higher, but for the largest values of the T in the array, the program was not executing as the size would overflow. Thus, results were neglected.\n","\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.3"},"colab":{"name":"CPII-HW4.ipynb","provenance":[],"collapsed_sections":[]}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
